## 🔥 DAILY POWER REMINDER

### TODAY'S TRUTH
Every day you wake up with two choices:
1. Drift in comfort
2. Move with purpose

**You're choosing option 2.**

### YOUR DAILY POWER STATEMENTS
Read these. Feel them. Act on them:

1. "I am in creation mode, not consumption mode."
   - My evenings belong to my growth
   - I create more than I consume
   - Every YouTube minute is borrowed from my future

2. "Each interaction is a rep for growth."
   - Rejection = Motion
   - Silent days are wasted days
   - One real conversation > 100 passive scrolls

3. "My energy is my power source."
   - Channel it into creation, not escape
   - Feel the hunger - it's fuel
   - Strong body, sharp mind, focused spirit

4. "I build value that scales."
   - Beyond time-for-money
   - Show my edge, share my journey
   - Create once, benefit many

[ ] Did I speak to someone new today?
[ ] Did I create something today?
