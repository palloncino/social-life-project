## 🌟 OPEN CIRCLE - REAL TALK FOR REAL PEOPLE

### 🎯 THE VISION
A local, in-person space where people come together to reflect, share, and discuss what it means to live well in today's world. Not therapy, not debate, not political — just human beings being human together.

### 💫 WHY THIS MATTERS
- In a world of digital noise, we need real connection
- Many feel lost but have nowhere to share that feeling
- The simple act of gathering and talking is revolutionary
- We're building something that should exist but doesn't
